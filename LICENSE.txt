This project originally called: FourteenDayFarmer_DreamOfFullPineapple.
But me, the only programmer in origin team, changed it to "Last 14 Days of Pinapples" and released it on Github.
(Original name is just way too long!)

So I keep the origin disclamior and its English version below.



========= Origin Disclaimor ==========
簡單來說：
此遊戲想怎麼散播、修改等都行，隨便你，但我們不負任何責任。

但請注意美術、音樂、字形是有可能有版權，請不要任意商用，以免侵犯原作者權益
